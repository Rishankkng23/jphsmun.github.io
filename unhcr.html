          The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a UN agency mandated to aid and protect refugees, forcibly displaced
communities, and stateless people, and to assist in their voluntary repatriation, local integration or resettlement to a third
country.
This committee was formed on 14 December, 1950 having their Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. During times of
displacement, they provide critical emergency assistance in the form of clean water, sanitation and healthcare, as well as shelter,
blankets, household goods and sometimes food. They also arrange transport and assistance packages for people who return
home, and income generating project for those who resettle.
For this year
’
s conference the committee will debate on the agenda
“Deliberating upon measures to counter statelessness with
special emphasis on the Belarusian Border Crisis
”
Since June 2021, thousands of people – mainly from Iraq but also from Syria, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo and
several other countries – have been trying to reach the European Union (EU) via Belarus. While Belarus has eased the migration
flows, political leaders from Poland and Lithuania have repeatedly accused the Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenka of
facilitating migrants and asylum seekers to cross EU borders. In response, EU countries have built fences, significantly increased
border patrols and declared a state of emergency along the border areas, which limits independent humanitarian assistance
organizations from entering the areas</div>
